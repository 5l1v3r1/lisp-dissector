packet-lisp.c
=============
* Instead of the static variable "encapsulated", use the col_set_fence()
  function
* Actually show the encapsulation header when present
* Dissect locator sets in detail, highlighting individual fields in the hex
  data
* Dissect maping records in detail, highlighting individual fields in the hex
  data
* Implement support for the following LCAF types:
   * AS Number (3)
   * Application Data (4)
   * Geo Coordinates (5)
   * Opaque Key (6)
   * Nonce Locator (8)
   * Multicast Info (9)
   * Security Key (11)
   * Source/Dest Key (12)
* Improve LCAF parsing robustness, by ignoring length when dissecting known
  types
* Jesper proposed a change in xTR-ID, extension with 64 bit site ID.
  Implement, once documented
* Implement support for LISP-SEC
